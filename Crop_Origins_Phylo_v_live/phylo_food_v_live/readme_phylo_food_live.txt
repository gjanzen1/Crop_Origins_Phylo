This is a readme file of the live (regularly updated) version of the Phylo Food phylogenetic tree, 
and of a non-fully resolved phylogenetic tree of 74736 species of vascular plants, including the 866 species of crops.

Phylo Food is a phylogenetic tree of the species in Crop Origins database. The tree is curated by Rubén Milla (ruben.milla@gmail.com), and is deposited and updated in github: https://github.com/rubenmilla/Crop_Origins_Phylo .
This folder contains five files:
A readme file (readme_ phylo_food_live.txt);
The R code used to build the tree (phylo_food_live_code.txt); 
the literature sources cited in the code and used to resolve the tree, in BibTeX format (sources_used_to_resolve_phylo_food_live.txt); 
the time-calibrated and fully resolved phylogenetic tree of crop species (phylo_food_live.tre);
the non-fully resolved phylogenetic tree of vascular plants, including the 866 species of crops (phylo_GBOTB_with_crops_live.tre).
