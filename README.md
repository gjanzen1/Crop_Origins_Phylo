This is the repository of the "Crop Origins" database and of the "Phylo Food" phylogenetic tree, as described in Milla (2019).

**Crop Origins** is a comprehensive ckecklist of crops species cultivated for food. It includes associated data on diverse continuous and categorical descriptors of antiquity of cultivation, organ harvested for primary use, growth form, and identities, distribution and climate at sites of origin of crops´ wild progenitors.

**Phylo Food** is a time-calibrated and fully resolved phylogenetic tree of the species in **Crop Origins**.

This repository includes **[version 1.0](https://github.com/rubenmilla/Crop_Origins_Phylo/tree/master/Crop_Origins_Phylo_v1_0)**  of **Crop Origins** and **Phylo Food**, which is a static mirror of the supplementary material in Milla (2019); and **[a live version](https://github.com/rubenmilla/Crop_Origins_Phylo/tree/master/Crop_Origins_Phylo_v_live)** of both resources, meant to be regularly updated. In those folders you can find the resources, plus readme and metadata files.

This is work in progress, please do not hesitate to submit your feedback or alerts on new literature, either privately to the author (ruben.milla@gmail.com), or publicly through the Issues tab.
